# About this repository
This is the repository for the term-long database-driven web project in CS 257, Fall 2019.

Contents:
- Personas: directory, contains all personas developed for this project
- UserStories: directory, contains all your team's user stories
- Data: directory, contains the raw and processed data along with any metadataas well as python programs to run flask and interact with data. This also has two sub folders:
  - Templates: contains all html pages
  - Static: contains the background images and css file

NOTE: We chose to narrow the scope of our project in order to more fully meet the needs of a subset of our planned users. As a result, we did not include tags and family-friendly filters; however, we decided to still leave the user stories and personas that reference those tools given that they accurately represent part of our process in developing this website.

NOTE: If one or two books are returned, our website should simply show those two despite the html code anticipating three. However, we could not find instances of this in our data. Based on html behavior as we understand it, we are fairly confident that this will not be an issue. 

NOTE: We noticed that the homepage tag line is difficult to read (tree in background slightly obscures it) if the window is too small. We have not been able to find a satisfactory way to fix this.
