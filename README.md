# About this repository
This is the repository for the term-long database-driven web project in CS 257, Fall 2019.

NOTE: Our website is currently only completely legible (including the tagline) for widths less than 2/3ds of my laptop screen; otherwise, the black tree in the image obscures the tagline. Help with this would be welcome!
