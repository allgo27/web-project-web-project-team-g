We rewrote the getBookListIntersections() function because, just after we turned in the second half of the database query code, we realized that we actually had the getBookListIntersections() function returning userIDs rather than bookIDs. In order to make getBookListIntersections() work properly, we rewrote the segment of code that supplements bookDict with singly recommended books in cases where there is insufficient crossover in books liked by the fans of the input books. We entirely changed the structure from incorrectly iterating through fans and pulling a random book from each to checking how many books were needed in order to return three books, then pulling those books from the first fan with at least that many liked books. The initial code was overly complex, so we decided to simplify. After testing our newly written code on mock data in order to make sure that we are receiving what we intend to, we now know that our simpler code is more effective and more accurate.
